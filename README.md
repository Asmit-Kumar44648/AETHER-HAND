Welcome to **Aether-Hand**, a "funny business" project that turns your webcam into a gateway for the Mystic Arts. This isn't just a shiny demo—it’s a fusion of Computer Vision and high-performance WebGL rendering.

## 🧪 The Science Behind the Magic
While it looks like pure chaos, there's some heavy lifting happening under the hood:

* **Neural Tracking:** Powered by **MediaPipe**, the engine tracks 21 distinct 3D landmarks on your hand at 30+ FPS.
* **Particle Physics:** Over **65,000 active particles** computed every frame using **Three.js**.
* **Thermal Shading:** Particles use a custom "Heat-Map" logic—glowing white-hot at the core and cooling to deep ember-red at the edges.
* **Spectral Momentum:** Magic has "weight." The sigils use linear interpolation (lerp) to trail behind your hand movements with realistic inertia.

## 🕹️ The Spellbook (Gestures)
The engine detects the number of fingers extended to trigger different dimensional geometries:

| Gesture | Spell Name | Visual Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🖐️ **Open Palm** | **Tao Mandala** | 6-Layer counter-rotating runic rings. |
| ☝️ **Pointer** | **Eldritch Bolt** | A high-velocity swirling energy tether. |
| ✌️ **Peace Sign** | **Mirror Shatter** | Crystalline geometric dispersal pattern. |
| 🤘 **Devil Horns** | **Ikonn Illusion** | Concentric Eldritch squares (The Illusionist's Sigil). |
| ✊ **Fist** | **Time Loop** | An emerald green pulsing cube (Agamotto Style). |

## 💡 Pro-Tips for Sorcerers
* **Lighting Matters:** The AI likes high-contrast lighting. Magic is easier to weave when it can see your fingers!
* **Performance:** If your computer starts sounding like a jet engine, that's just the particles trying to break into the Mirror Dimension.
