# 🧙‍♂️ AETHER-HAND: Sanctum Intern Simulator

Welcome to my "funny business" project. I spent way too much time watching *Doctor Strange* and decided that instead of doing actual work, I would teach my browser how to recognize my finger wiggling as high-level sorcery.

## 🧪 What is this?
It's a real-time, gesture-controlled particle engine. 
- **The Brains:** MediaPipe Hand Landmarker (Neural Network) tracking 21 points on your hand.
- **The Beauty:** Three.js (WebGL) rendering 65,000 "Eldritch" particles with custom physics and thermal shading.
- **The Vibe:** Pure Sanctum Sanctorum energy.

## 🕹️ The Spellbook (Gestures)
To invoke the magic, face your camera and try these:
- **Open Palm:** Tao Mandala (Concentric protective shields).
- **Index Finger Point:** Eldritch Bolt (High-velocity energy tether).
- **Peace Sign (2 Fingers):** Mirror Dimension (Geometric crystal shattering).
- **Devil Horns (3 Fingers):** Ikonn Illusion (The square-within-square sigil).
- **The Fist:** Time Loop (Emerald green geometric pulse).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Three.js:** For the shiny dots and 3D math.
- **MediaPipe Hands:** The AI that judges your hand movements.
- **Vanilla JS:** No heavy frameworks, just pure wizardry.

## 📂 Deployment (The 1-Minute Path)
1. Upload the `index.html` to your repo.
2. Go to **Settings > Pages**.
3. Set the branch to `main` and hit **Save**.
4. You're now the Sorcerer Supreme of your own URL.
